| **Scene**                             | **Duration** | **Visual Elements**                                                                                                          | **On-Screen Text / Captions**                                                      | **Narration (summary)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Transition / Notes**                      |

| **1. Context: Why We’re Building It** | 0:00 – 0:30  | Fade-in from white. Company logo → subtle motion of incoming emails filling a screen → stopwatch icon.                       | Title: *“RAG Email System”*  Subtitle: *“Grounded automation for real work.”*      | “Many of our teams handle high volumes of repetitive email. Finding accurate answers across documents takes time. The RAG Email System uses retrieval-augmented generation to produce grounded draft responses, reducing effort while maintaining accuracy.” | Fade-in; calm background color (#f5f6f7).   |
| **2. Purpose of This Phase**          | 0:30 – 1:00  | Diagram: three labeled blocks — *Prototype*, *Shadow Testing*, *Pilot*. Highlight “Prototype.”                               | Caption: *“Phase: Prototype (Pre-Testing)”*                                        | “The current phase is focused on technical readiness — confirming that the system functions end-to-end and meets governance and safety standards before any live trials begin.”                                                                              | Slide morph to the system diagram.          |
| **3. System Overview**                | 1:00 – 1:30  | Animated workflow: Gmail → Workato → Vertex AI → Cloud Storage → Gmail (Draft).                                              | “Automated workflow, no outbound messages.”                                        | “When a message arrives, automation retrieves relevant internal material, composes a draft, and saves it securely as a Gmail draft. The system does not send messages; it only generates candidates for later review.”                                       | Line animation left→right.                  |
| **4. What’s Working Now**             | 1:30 – 2:00  | Split-screen: left shows connector logs, right shows structured draft JSON with citations.                                   | “Functional pipeline” • “Telemetry enabled” • “Security enforced”                  | “Core components are in place — connectors, retrieval, generation, and telemetry. Every step is logged and auditable. Drafts include citations linking back to verified documents.”                                                                          | Cross-fade to a simplified dashboard.       |
| **5. Preparing for Testing**          | 2:00 – 2:45  | Dashboard mock-up showing “Accuracy,” “Latency,” “Cost” placeholders labelled *To be measured*.                              | “Next: Shadow Testing.”                                                            | “In the upcoming phase, the system will process real inbound emails silently, storing drafts for analysis. Reviewers will measure factual accuracy, response time, and cost before any human-in-loop pilot begins.”                                          | Slide transition upward to visual timeline. |
| **6. Governance and Safety**          | 2:45 – 3:15  | Icons: shield → lock → eye → check mark.                                                                                     | Bullet list: *Access control* • *Encryption* • *Human oversight* • *Audit logging* | “The system runs under strict access control. Data is encrypted in storage and transit. All actions are logged for traceability. Human review remains integral to every test.”                                                                               | Fade-through-black between icons.           |
| **7. What Success Looks Like**        | 3:15 – 3:45  | Table or checklist showing target metrics (Accuracy ≥ 95 %, Latency ≤ 6 s, Compliance = 0 incidents) without bars or gauges. | “Measured goals for testing.”                                                      | “Testing will confirm that the system produces accurate, well-sourced drafts quickly and safely. These metrics define readiness for the next phase.”                                                                                                         | Slide-in checklist.                         |
| **8. Next Steps**                     | 3:45 – 4:00  | Workflow diagram reappears, highlight *Shadow Testing → Pilot*.                                                              | “Entering controlled testing.”                                                     | “The next phase begins with silent, controlled testing. Feedback from reviewers will guide refinements before limited pilot deployment.”                                                                                                                     | Fade to white.                              |
| **9. Closing Slide**                  | 4:00 – 4:05  | White background, centered logo. Tagline below.                                                                              | “RAG Email System”  line break  “Grounded automation for real work.”               | No narration beyond tagline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Fade out.                                   |
