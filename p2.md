Got you. I’ll treat this like a small SDLC pack you can drop into your team’s Confluence / Drive.

Below are **four documents** in one response:

1. **Requirements Specification (SRS)**
2. **Solution Design (HLD/LLD with data model)**
3. **Implementation Plan (Phase 2)**
4. **Test Plan (Phase 1 & 2)**

You can split them into separate files as needed.

## Document 1 – Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Project name:** Contractor Performance, Engagement & Risk Tracking
**Version:** 0.1
**Owner:** <Your name / team>
**Date:** <Date>

### 1. Purpose

This document defines the **functional and non-functional requirements** for a system that tracks contractor performance and client engagement health. It covers both:

* **Phase 1:** Data model and reference design (no rollout)
* **Phase 2:** First operational tool for managers and leaders

### 2. Scope

The system will provide a structured way to:

* Represent **contractors**, **managers**, **clients**, **engagements**, **client stakeholders**, and **interactions** between them.
* Track **performance and risk signals** at contractor, engagement, client, and manager levels.
* Support **reporting and decision-making** for performance management and client health.

Phase 1 produces design artifacts only (no production deployment).
Phase 2 delivers the first live implementation used by managers and leaders.

### 3. Stakeholders

* **Business Owner / Sponsor**
* **Process Owner / SME** – defines rules, statuses, “at-risk” logic
* **Front-line Managers** – primary operational users
* **Leaders (Senior Managers / Directors)** – consumers of rollups and dashboards
* **Analytics / BI** – consumers of the data for deeper analysis
* **Product / Engineering / Automation Team** – implement and maintain the solution

### 4. Assumptions & Constraints

* Contractor teams work on **client-specific engagements** managed by named managers.
* Tooling can be implemented in **Google Sheets, a database-backed app, or a hybrid**, but the **data model must remain stable** across implementations.
* Volume is moderate (hundreds to low thousands of contractors), not millions.
* System is for **internal use** only; no external client access in scope.
* Phase 1 will use **sample data** only; no migration of real data at that stage.

### 5. Functional Requirements

#### 5.1 Core Data Representation

* **R1** – The system shall represent the following entities:

  * Managers
  * Clients (accounts)
  * Client stakeholders
  * Engagements (manager + client + scope)
  * Contractors
  * Interactions (1:1s, client meetings, escalations, kudos, coaching, PIP milestones)

* **R2** – The system shall store relationships between entities such that:

  * Each **engagement** is associated with exactly one **client** and one **primary manager**.
  * Each **contractor** has:

    * A primary **manager**
    * A primary **engagement**
    * A primary **client** (usually derived from engagement)
  * Each **client stakeholder** is associated with exactly one **client** and optionally a **relationship owner manager**.
  * Each **interaction** may reference:

    * An engagement
    * A contractor (where applicable)
    * A manager
    * A client
    * A client stakeholder (where applicable)

* **R3** – Each entity shall have a stable, unique identifier (e.g., `manager_id`, `contractor_id`) that does not depend on names or human-readable text.

#### 5.2 Interactions & History

* **R4** – The system shall maintain a chronological **interaction log** including:

  * Manager–contractor 1:1s
  * Client stakeholder meetings
  * Client escalations
  * Client kudos (positive feedback)
  * Internal coaching conversations
  * PIP milestones and other formal performance steps

* **R5** – Each interaction shall record at minimum:

  * Date of interaction
  * Type of interaction
  * Related entities (engagement, manager, contractor, client, stakeholder, as applicable)
  * Short summary
  * Optional detailed notes

* **R6** – Interactions shall support the capture of:

  * Sentiment (e.g., Positive / Neutral / Negative)
  * Impact area (e.g., Quality, SLA, Communication, Relationship)
  * Whether follow-up is needed and by when
  * Whether the interaction is a formal performance step

#### 5.3 Performance & Risk Indicators

* **R7** – The system shall maintain contractor-level fields for:

  * Contractor status (e.g., Active, On PIP, Exited)
  * PIP status (e.g., None, Informal, Formal, Completed)
  * Risk flag (e.g., None, Watch, At risk)
  * Optionally: derived “at-risk indicator” based on business rules

* **R8** – The system shall support calculation of derived metrics, including:

  * Last 1:1 date per contractor
  * Recent client escalations and kudos for each contractor (e.g., last 30 days)
  * Count of at-risk contractors per engagement
  * 1:1 coverage rate per manager over a defined window

* **R9** – The system shall support viewing the **history** behind any risk signal (e.g., interactions that contributed to a contractor being considered at-risk).

#### 5.4 Views & Reporting

* **R10** – The system shall support **contractor-level views**, including:

  * Current status, PIP status, risk flag
  * At-risk indicator
  * History of relevant interactions (1:1s, escalations, PIP milestones, etc.)

* **R11** – The system shall support **manager-level views**, including:

  * List of contractors they manage
  * 1:1 coverage metrics
  * Count of at-risk contractors
  * Engagements and clients under their responsibility

* **R12** – The system shall support **engagement/client-level views**, including:

  * Number of active contractors
  * Number of at-risk contractors
  * Volume and trend of client escalations vs kudos

* **R13** – The system shall provide data suitable for **analytics and reporting**, via:

  * Export or direct access for analysts (e.g., BI tools, warehouse views)
  * Clearly defined schemas and relationships

#### 5.5 Phase-Specific Requirements

* **R14 (Phase 1)** – A **reference Google Sheets workbook** shall be produced that:

  * Implements the logical data model
  * Includes enumerations, validation, and core formulas
  * Uses sample data only

* **R15 (Phase 2)** – A **production-ready implementation** shall be provided that:

  * Uses the agreed data model
  * Allows managers and leaders to log, view, and act on data in regular operations
  * Implements agreed automation and dashboards (see Implementation Plan)

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1 – Transparency:** Risk rules and derived metrics shall be documented and observable by SME/analysts.
* **NFR2 – Usability:** Interaction logging should be quick (target: < 1–2 minutes per entry in the operational tool).
* **NFR3 – Maintainability:** SMEs/analysts should be able to adjust enums and basic thresholds without major engineering changes.
* **NFR4 – Auditability:** Interactions and key field changes (e.g., PIP status) should be traceable to user and timestamp in the operational system.
* **NFR5 – Scalability:** System should handle current and foreseeable scale of contractors, engagements, and interactions without significant performance issues.
* **NFR6 – Security:** Access to data shall respect role boundaries (e.g., managers see their span; leaders see their org; admins/analysts have broader access).

### 7. Out of Scope (Current Phases)

* Integration with HRIS/payroll/vendor systems
* Automated ingestion from email/calendar
* External client-facing access
* Full performance management workflows (ratings, compensation, etc.)

## Document 2 – Solution Design (HLD + LLD for Data Model)

**Project name:** Contractor Performance, Engagement & Risk Tracking
**Version:** 0.1
**Owner:** <Your name / team>

### 1. Purpose

This document defines the **solution design** for the project, focusing on:

* Conceptual and logical data model
* Business rules around risk and performance
* Phase 1 reference implementation in Google Sheets

### 2. Architecture Overview

High-level structure:

* **Conceptual layer:** Managers, Contractors, Clients, Engagements, Stakeholders, Interactions.
* **Logical data model:** Normalized tables/sheets with stable IDs and foreign keys.
* **Phase 1:** Reference implementation as a Google Sheets workbook with sample data and formulas.
* **Phase 2:** Implementation in a production-ready stack (e.g., DB + app or hardened Sheets) based on this model.

The data model is designed to be **technology-agnostic**; specific physical implementation details will be defined during Phase 2.

### 3. Conceptual Model

**Entities:**

* **Manager** – Internal manager responsible for contractors and engagements.
* **Client** – External company receiving services.
* **Client Stakeholder** – Named individual at the client.
* **Engagement** – A defined scope of work for a client, owned by a manager.
* **Contractor** – Individual worker (vendor/BPO/contractor).
* **Interaction** – Logged touchpoint or event (1:1, client meeting, escalation, kudos, coaching, PIP step).

**Key relationships:**

* A **Client** has many **Engagements**.
* An **Engagement** has one primary **Manager** and many **Contractors**.
* A **Client** has many **Client Stakeholders**.
* A **Manager** may be the relationship owner for some **Stakeholders**.
* **Interactions** may involve:

  * One **Engagement**
  * One **Manager**
  * Zero or one **Contractor**
  * Zero or one **Client Stakeholder**
  * One **Client**

* `interaction_type`: as listed above
* `sentiment`: Positive, Neutral, Negative
* `impact_area`: Quality, SLA, Communication, Process, Relationship, Other

These enums are shared between the reference workbook and the production implementation.

### 6. Business Rules

#### 6.1 At-Risk Indicator (v1 Draft)

A contractor is considered **at-risk** if:

* They are `status = Active`, **and** one of the following holds:

  * `pip_status` is a formal stage (e.g., “Formal PIP”, “Final PIP”), **or**
  * `risk_flag = "At risk"`, **or**
  * They have at least 1 client escalation and 0 client kudos in the last 30 days.

This rule will be refined with the SME based on data and experience.

#### 6.2 1:1 Cadence

* Expectation: active contractors receive at least one 1:1 in a given period (e.g., 30 days).
* A contractor is considered **out of 1:1 compliance** if:

  * `status = Active` and
  * `last_1x1_date` is more than X days ago (e.g., 30).

#### 6.3 Client Health (Engagement-Level Signals)

Example indicators:

* Number of `client_escalation` interactions in the last N days.
* Ratio of escalations to kudos.
* Number and proportion of at-risk contractors on the engagement.

Exact thresholds and categorizations (e.g., “Green/Amber/Red”) can be defined and adjusted later.

### 7. Phase 1 Reference Workbook

The reference Google Sheets workbook will:

* Implement the logical tables as individual sheets:

  * `Managers`, `Clients`, `Client_stakeholders`, `Engagements`, `Contractors`, `Interactions`, optional `Contractor_assignments`, and `Enums`.
* Use **data validation** rules to enforce enums and relationships where possible.
* Include **formulas** to compute:

  * `last_1x1_date` from Interactions
  * `last_client_feedback_date`
  * `escalations_30d`, `kudos_30d`
  * `at_risk_flag`
  * Engagement-level and manager-level aggregates (counts, coverage)

The workbook uses **sample data** to validate the model, rules, and formulas and acts as an **executable specification** for Phase 2.

## Document 3 – Implementation Plan (Phase 2)

**Project name:** Contractor Performance, Engagement & Risk Tracking
**Version:** 0.1

### 1. Objectives

* Implement a **production-ready system** based on the Phase 1 data model and rules.
* Enable managers and leaders to:

  * Log interactions
  * View contractor, engagement, and client health
  * Use risk signals and history to support decisions

### 2. Deliverables

* Production data store (e.g., DB schema / Sheets structure) aligned to logical data model.
* User-facing interface for:

  * Interaction logging
  * Contractor, engagement, manager views
* Core automation:

  * 1:1 cadence reminders (if in scope)
  * At-risk alerts (if in scope)
  * Follow-up reminders for flagged interactions
* Standard dashboards / reports.
* Migration of any initial seed data (if applicable).
* Documentation and basic training materials.

### 3. Implementation Approach & Phases

#### Phase 2.1 – Design Finalization

* Review and sign off Phase 1 artifacts:

  * Data model
  * Business rules
  * Reference workbook behavior
* Decide on implementation stack:

  * Option A: Hardened Google Sheets + Apps Script + Data Studio/Looker, etc.
  * Option B: Database + internal web app + BI tool
  * Option C: Hybrid

Deliverable: **Implementation design addendum** (maps logical model to physical tech stack).

#### Phase 2.2 – Build

* Implement physical schema and storage.
* Implement interaction logging UX:

  * Forms/pages/sheets to capture new interactions.
  * Validation for required fields and enums.
* Implement views:

  * Contractor detail view (with history).
  * Manager dashboard (1:1 coverage, at-risk list).
  * Engagement/client views (escalations vs kudos, at-risk counts).
* Implement automation (if in scope for the first release):

  * Scheduled jobs or scripts for reminders/alerts.

#### Phase 2.3 – Data Migration (if needed)

* Decide whether historical spreadsheet data will be migrated.
* If yes:

  * Map old columns to new model.
  * Clean and transform data.
  * Load into the new system.
* Validate migrated data via spot checks and SME review.

#### Phase 2.4 – Testing & UAT

* Execute Test Plan (see Test Plan document).
* UAT with a pilot group of managers and leaders:

  * Validate usability and data correctness.
  * Collect feedback for small adjustments.

#### Phase 2.5 – Rollout

* Roll out to broader set of managers/leaders.
* Deliver short training and quick-reference material.
* Monitor early usage and errors.

### 4. Roles & Responsibilities

* **Product / Project Owner:** priorities, scoping, stakeholder alignment.
* **Process Owner / SME:** business rules, acceptance of model and behavior.
* **Engineering / Tools Team:** technical design, build, deployment.
* **Analytics / BI:** dashboards, advanced reporting.
* **Pilot Managers:** early feedback, UAT participation.
* **Support / Operations:** post-go-live triage and support.

### 5. Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk:** Overly complex UI reduces manager adoption.
  **Mitigation:** Start with minimal usable workflow for logging and views; iterate based on feedback.

* **Risk:** At-risk rules not trusted by managers.
  **Mitigation:** Begin with conservative rules; review early signal patterns with SME and managers; adjust.

* **Risk:** Scope creep into full HR/performance systems.
  **Mitigation:** Clearly document out-of-scope items and future phases.

## Document 4 – Test Plan (Phase 1 & 2)

**Project name:** Contractor Performance, Engagement & Risk Tracking
**Version:** 0.1

### 1. Purpose

Define the approach to testing the solution across:

* **Phase 1:** Validating the data model and reference workbook.
* **Phase 2:** Testing the production implementation (data, logic, UI).

### 2. Test Objectives

* Verify that the data model can support the **required use cases and queries**.
* Validate that **business rules** (e.g., at-risk logic, 1:1 cadence) behave as specified.
* Ensure the **operational tool** is usable, reliable, and accurate for managers and leaders.

### 3. Scope

**In scope:**

* Data model validation (entities, relationships).
* Derived metrics validation (last 1:1, risk flags, counts).
* UI workflows for interaction logging and viewing.
* Dashboards / reports for managers and leaders.

**Out of scope (initial release):**

* Performance/load testing at massive scale.
* End-to-end testing of external integrations (if they are not part of Phase 2).

### 4. Test Types

#### 4.1 Phase 1 – Design & Reference Workbook Testing

* **Model coverage tests**

  * Confirm that each requirement/question (R1–R13 from SRS) can be answered using the reference workbook.
* **Formula correctness tests**

  * Test cases with controlled sample data for:

    * last_1x1_date
    * last_client_feedback_date
    * escalations_30d, kudos_30d
    * at_risk_flag logic
    * 1:1 coverage calculations per manager
* **SME validation**

  * Walk through realistic scenarios with Process Owner:

    * “Given this interaction history, would you expect this contractor to be at risk?”
      Verify the sheet’s behavior matches expectations.

Deliverable: **Phase 1 Test Summary** indicating the model and workbook are fit to guide implementation.

#### 4.2 Phase 2 – System Testing

* **Unit / Component tests**

  * At-risk calculation logic.
  * 1:1 cadence logic.
  * Data validation rules (correct handling of required fields, enums).

* **Integration tests**

  * Logging an interaction leads to:

    * Expected changes in contractor-level metrics.
    * Updated manager/engagement dashboards.
  * Data flows correctly through storage, processing, and UI layers.

* **System tests**

  * End-to-end workflows:

    * “Manager logs a 1:1 → contractor view updates.”
    * “Client escalation logged → engagement/client health reflects the change.”
    * “At-risk thresholds crossed → risk indicators update as expected.”

* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

  * Pilot group of managers and leaders:

    * Complete common tasks (log a 1:1, review team risk, review client health).
    * Provide structured feedback on usability and correctness.
  * UAT exit criteria:

    * No critical defects.
    * SME and pilot managers sign off that the system supports their key decisions.

### 5. Test Data

* **Phase 1:**

  * Synthetic sample data designed to cover edge cases:

    * Contractors on/ off PIP
    * Multiple engagements
    * Various interaction patterns (lots of kudos, lots of escalations, no feedback)
* **Phase 2:**

  * Combination of:

    * Clean migrated historical data (if applicable).
    * Controlled test data sets.
    * Small amount of live data during pilot phase.

### 6. Entry & Exit Criteria

**Phase 1 – Entry:**

* Requirements SRS drafted.
* Initial conceptual model defined.

**Phase 1 – Exit:**

* Logical data model validated for all key questions.
* Reference workbook formulas tested and signed off by SME.
* Known gaps and limitations documented.

**Phase 2 – Entry:**
