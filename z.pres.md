Here’s a clean, boardroom-ready slide deck you can paste directly into Google Slides or PowerPoint. It’s formatted for clarity, brevity, and authority — no fluff, no jargon walls, and designed so you can walk through it in under five minutes.

If you want a version with speaker notes, I can generate that too.

# **Slide 1 — Title**

**RAG Email System
Progress Update & Architecture Overview**

**Presenter:** Emily Cabaniss
**Audience:** Manager + Senior Manager
**Date:**

---

# **Slide 2 — Executive Summary**

**What’s new:**
The system now follows a modern, industry-aligned RAG architecture that improves accuracy, reduces cost, and adds strong safety controls.

**Why it matters:**
It positions us for scalable, reliable AI-assisted support with measurable performance and clear guardrails.

---

# **Slide 3 — Industry-Aligned Architecture**

**Modern multi-stage design:**
Early Filtering → Semantic Retrieval → Reranking → Grounded Generation

**Why leaders care:**

* Industry best practice (Google Vertex AI, Pinecone)
* Low implementation risk
* High architectural credibility
* Not a bespoke experiment — a stable, validated pattern

---

# **Slide 4 — Filtering = Fast + Cost-Efficient**

**How the system works now:**

* Eliminates 60–70% of irrelevant emails before expensive steps
* Reduces unnecessary LLM calls
* Keeps latency predictable
* Prevents incorrect automated replies

**Outcome:**
Efficiency + accuracy without increasing spend.

---

# **Slide 5 — Two-Stage Retrieval Improves Precision**

**Step 1:** Embeddings for fast, broad retrieval
**Step 2:** LLM reranking for correctness and relevance

**Benefits:**

* Right data → right moment → right cost
* Matches Google/Pinecone recommended pattern
* Avoids over-reliance on LLMs
* Higher accuracy with lower overhead

---

# **Slide 6 — Context Optimization**

**Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR):**
Removes duplicate or redundant context, improving factual grounding.

**Token-budget control:**
Ensures model input stays within safe limits → predictable latency and cost.

**Result:**
Higher-quality answers with tight operational control.

---

# **Slide 7 — Salience Extraction**

**What it does:**
Extracts the essential sentence/paragraph from each email.

**Why it matters:**

* Focuses the AI on the core request
* Reduces noise
* Improves accuracy
* Safer + clearer responses

---

# **Slide 8 — Confidence Gating**

**Business protection built in:**

* High-confidence → automated response
* Low-confidence → human handoff
* Triage structure: IRRELEVANT / HUMAN / KEEP
* Category fallbacks ensure safety

**Outcome:**
Automation never outruns trust.

---

# **Slide 9 — Full Observability**

**What we measure:**

* Retrieval quality
* Ranking lift
* Token usage
* Confidence signals
* Latency + system health

**Why leadership cares:**

* Transparent performance
* Auditability
* Continuous improvement
* Predictable costs

---

# **Slide 10 — Research-Backed Approach**

The architecture directly aligns with:

* Google Vertex AI RAG Engine
* Pinecone RAG Best Practices
* EMNLP 2024 retrieval research
* Academic work on MMR and retrieval diversity

**Message:**
This system stands on strong shoulders.

---

# **Slide 11 — Current State → Business Value**

**Today:**
A reliable, explainable, controlled RAG system with strong accuracy and safety boundaries.

**Value Delivered:**

* Faster handling of employee questions
* Lower response-load on HR
* Lower operational cost
* High compliance and auditability
* Scalable foundation for future domains

---

# **Slide 12 — What’s Next**

* Expand categories
* Improve ranking lift using real-world telemetry
* Integrate stronger policy models
* Extend to additional use-cases
* Add performance dashboards for leadership

---

# **Slide 13 — Thank You**

Questions?
Happy to walk through architecture, metrics, or next steps.

If you'd like, I can produce:

* A matching **diagram pack** (architecture, pipeline stages, data flow)
* A **speaker-notes version** of each slide
* A **one-page handout** summarizing the entire system for directors
* A **deep-dive appendix** for senior technical leadership

Just say the word and I’ll generate it.
