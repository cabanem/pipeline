Here’s a refactored Project Brief that bakes in the new reality: managers/leaders as primary users, contractors working on client engagements, and logging both 1:1s and client stakeholder meetings.

You can treat this as v0.2 and tweak names/dates.

# Contractor Performance Tracking – Project Brief (v0.2)

**Project name**
Contractor Performance History, Engagement & Risk Tracking (Phase 1)

**Process owner / SME**

**Date**
*TBD*

## Executive Summary

This initiative standardizes how we track **contractor performance and client-facing health at the engagement level**.

Today, performance information is scattered across a “master” spreadsheet, individual tabs, and email. It is highly dependent on one long-tenured process owner’s tacit knowledge and on managers’ personal note-taking habits.

Phase 1 replaces this with:

* A single **structured contractor register**
* A **manager- and engagement-centric model** (manager running a team for a client)
* A centralized **interactions log** for 1:1s, coaching, escalations, kudos, PIP milestones, and client stakeholder meetings

All of this will be implemented in **Google Sheets** with simple dashboards and transparent risk flags.

Phase 2 (future) may build a lightweight application and automation layer on top of the same schema once we’ve validated the structure, rules, and usability in practice.

## 1. Purpose & Context

This project aims to move the business unit from ad-hoc, spreadsheet-based tracking to a **consistent, engagement-aware model** that supports better decisions about:

* Coaching and development
* Performance-improvement plans (PIPs)
* Client communication and stakeholder management
* Contract and staffing actions

Key context:

* Managers and leaders are the **primary users**. They manage teams of contractors who support specific **clients/engagements**.
* Important signals live in many places:

  * 1:1 conversations
  * Client stakeholder meetings
  * Informal feedback
  * Formal performance steps (PIPs, warnings)
* Today, it is difficult to answer basic questions like:

  * “Who is at risk on this client right now, and why?”
  * “Is this manager keeping up with 1:1s?”
  * “Is this client starting to become noisy or unstable?”
  * “What history supports a performance or contract decision?”

The new model focuses on capturing these signals in a way that is **simple for managers** and **reliable for leadership**.

---

## 2. Users & Use Cases

### Primary users

* **Front-line managers** of contractor teams
* **Leaders** (senior managers / directors) overseeing multiple managers and clients
* **Process owner / SME** responsible for performance policy and consistency

### Core use cases

Manager-level:

* Log and review **1:1s** with contractors
* Log and review **meetings with client stakeholders**
* Track PIP milestones and outcomes
* See which contractors need attention (e.g., at risk, overdue for 1:1, recurring client issues)

Leadership-level:

* See **engagement health** by client and manager (risk, escalations, kudos, staffing)
* Compare **1:1 coverage** across managers
* Understand **where risks are concentrated** (by client, engagement, manager)
* Support decisions on renewals, exits, role changes, and scope changes with a clear history

Analyst / SME-level:

* Tune business rules for “at risk” signals
* Identify patterns across clients, vendors, or managers
* Prepare reports for leadership without manual reconstruction from emails and scattered tabs

---

## 3. In Scope (Phase 1)

Phase 1 focuses on a **structured Google Sheets implementation** of the new model:

* **Entities & structure**

  * Contractors (one row per contractor)
  * Managers
  * Clients (accounts)
  * Engagements (manager + client + scope)
  * Client stakeholders (named individuals at the client)
  * Interactions log (central log of 1:1s, client meetings, escalations, kudos, PIP milestones, internal coaching)

* **Key capabilities**

  * Single, authoritative **Contractor register** (status, PIP, risk, manager, engagement, client)
  * **Engagement-centric view**: each contractor is tied to an engagement; each engagement is tied to a client and a primary manager
  * **Interactions log** supports:

    * Manager–contractor 1:1s
    * Client stakeholder meetings
    * Client escalations and kudos
    * Internal coaching conversations
    * Formal performance steps (e.g., PIP milestones, written warnings)
  * Derived indicators such as:

    * Last 1:1 date per contractor
    * Client escalations vs kudos over the last X days
    * “At risk” flag per contractor (based on PIP status, risk flags, and client feedback)
    * Engagement-level rollups (active contractor count, at-risk count)
    * Manager-level rollups (1:1 coverage, number of at-risk contractors)

* **Basic reporting & dashboards**

  * Filterable views for managers
  * Simple pivot tables and charts for leadership (e.g., risk by engagement, risk by manager, escalation trends)

---

## 4. Out of Scope (Phase 1)

The following are explicitly **not** in scope for the first phase:

* Building a custom web or mobile application
* Direct integration with HR systems, ticketing tools, or vendor platforms
* Automated ingestion of email/calendar data
* Automated performance decisioning (no system-generated PIP/exit decisions)
* Complex capacity planning or financial modeling

These may be considered for Phase 2 or later once the **data model and workflows are stable**.

---

## 5. High-Level Solution Design (Phase 1)

Phase 1 delivers a **structured but lightweight** solution in Google Sheets:

1. **Master data sheets**

   * `Managers` – one row per manager
   * `Clients` – one row per client account
   * `Client_stakeholders` – one row per stakeholder, linked to a client and an internal relationship owner
   * `Engagements` – one row per engagement (client + scope + primary manager)
   * `Contractors` – one row per contractor, tied to manager, engagement, and client

2. **Interactions log**

   * A centralized `Interactions` sheet where **managers log events**:

     * 1:1s with contractors
     * Meetings with client stakeholders
     * Client escalations and kudos
     * Internal coaching conversations
     * PIP milestones and formal performance steps
   * Each interaction is tagged with:

     * Engagement
     * Contractor (if applicable)
     * Manager
     * Client and/or stakeholder
     * Type, date, sentiment, impact area, follow-up needed

3. **Business rules & derived fields**

   * Formulas compute:

     * Last 1:1 date per contractor
     * Escalations and kudos in recent time windows
     * At-risk flag based on rule sets from the process owner/SME
     * Engagement- and manager-level summaries

4. **Views for different audiences**

   * Managers: filtered views / simple dashboards for “my contractors,” “my engagements”
   * Leaders: aggregated views for “by client,” “by manager,” “by engagement”
   * SME/analyst: base tables + interaction log for deeper analysis

This creates a **single source of truth** that is still simple enough to be maintained by business users and analysts.

---

## 6. Business Rules (Initial Draft)

These are examples and will be refined with the process owner/SME:

* **Contractor status**

  * Active / On PIP / Exited / On hold

* **PIP status**

  * None / Informal / Formal PIP / Completed / Terminated

* **Risk flag**

  * None / Watch / At risk
    Set manually by managers and/or derived from pattern-based rules.

* **At-risk indicator (derived)**

  * Contractor is considered **at risk** if:

    * They are Active, **and**
    * PIP status is at a formal stage, **or**
    * Risk flag is “At risk”, **or**
    * They have recent client escalations with no offsetting positive feedback
  * Exact rule thresholds (e.g., “≥1 escalation and 0 kudos in last 30 days”) are configurable.

* **1:1 expectations**

  * Define expected cadence (e.g., every 30 days for active contractors).
  * Contractors outside the cadence are flagged on dashboards.

* **Client health indicators**

  * At the engagement level, combine:

    * Number of escalations vs kudos
    * Number of at-risk contractors
    * Turnover / exits on that engagement
  * These are intended as **signals**, not automatic judgments.

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Transparency**

  * Managers and leaders should be able to see **how** risk flags are calculated.
  * No “black box” scoring: rules and formulas are visible in the sheet.

* **Simplicity**

  * Data entry for managers should be **fast and repeatable** (data validation lists, minimal mandatory fields).
  * The model is structured enough to be reliable, but not so complex that people avoid using it.

* **Maintainability**

  * Designed so that a process owner or analyst can adjust:

    * Risk thresholds
    * Enum values (statuses, interaction types)
    * Basic derived formulas
      without engineering support.

* **Auditability**

  * Interactions log provides an **evidence trail** for performance decisions.
  * Historical data is retained; changes don’t silently overwrite history.

* **Scalability (lightweight)**

  * Expected to handle the current contractor volume and a reasonable growth margin within Sheets.
  * Structure is ready to be migrated to a database or app later without redesigning the logic from scratch.

---

## 8. Risks & Open Questions

* **Adoption risk**

  * If managers don’t log 1:1s and interactions consistently, the data will be incomplete.
    *Mitigation:* keep the logging workflow very simple, provide training and example use cases.

* **Rule tuning**

  * Initial “at risk” rules may be too sensitive or too lax.
    *Mitigation:* treat the first 1–2 months as a calibration period; review patterns with the SME and adjust.

* **Data ownership & governance**

  * Need clarity on who owns:

    * Keeping master data (managers, clients, engagements) up to date
    * Reviewing risk patterns and acting on them
      *Mitigation:* assign explicit roles and review cadence.

* **Future integration expectations**

  * Stakeholders may quickly want integrations or automation once they see the value.
    *Mitigation:* clearly frame Phase 1 as **proving the model and rules**, with Phase 2 focused on app/automation.

---

This version keeps the overall intent of the original brief but reflects the new reality: managers and leaders tracking not just individual contractors, but **teams working for clients**, with a shared log of **1:1s, client meetings, and performance events** that can actually survive contact with real-world use.
