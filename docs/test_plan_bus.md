# **RAG Email System – Test and Validation Plan (Leadership Summary)**

### **Purpose**

This plan outlines the structured validation of the RAG email system before it becomes part of live operations.
The objective is to ensure that the system delivers accurate, traceable, and compliant draft responses while maintaining stability and cost control.

---

## **1. Overview**

The RAG system assists in drafting email responses by drawing on verified internal information.
Testing will confirm that the system behaves as expected under controlled conditions before any interaction with end users.

The testing approach progresses from internal validation to limited pilot use, with measurable outcomes at each stage.

## **2. Testing Phases**

| **Phase**                          | **Objective**                                 | **Description**                                                                                                             | **Exit Criteria**                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Internal Readiness**          | Confirm stability and integration             | Verify connections between Gmail, Workato, and Google Cloud. Resolve integration or configuration issues.                   | Core workflows execute without error.                                                                |
| **2. Shadow Testing (Alpha)**      | Observe behavior without user exposure        | The system operates in the background, creating draft responses that are not sent. Results are logged for later review.     | ≥95% of drafts correctly cite sources. ≤5% factual error rate. Consistent performance within limits. |
| **3. Controlled Evaluation**       | Measure accuracy on known data                | Use a curated dataset (“golden set”) of real, anonymized emails with verified answers to assess factual grounding and tone. | Quantitative accuracy and relevance scores documented.                                               |
| **4. Limited Pilot (Beta)**        | Assess practical value with human oversight   | Enable draft creation in Gmail for a small group. Users review and edit before sending.                                     | Drafting time reduced by 50–60%. User satisfaction ≥4/5.                                             |
| **5. Scale and Safety Validation** | Confirm reliability and compliance under load | Test higher message volumes and review access permissions, logging, and security configuration.                             | Stable throughput and no compliance findings.                                                        |
| **6. Go / No-Go Decision**         | Determine readiness for wider use             | Review results, costs, and residual risks. Confirm rollback plan.                                                           | Leadership approval recorded; readiness confirmed.                                                   |

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**          | ≥95% grounded, factually correct outputs      |
| **Reliability**       | ≥99% successful message handling              |
| **Latency**           | 90% of responses generated in under 6 seconds |
| **Efficiency**        | 50–60% reduction in drafting time             |

## **7. Summary**

The testing process is structured, evidence-based, and sequential.
Each phase provides measurable proof of performance before progressing to the next.
The system will not interact with customers or send email autonomously until its accuracy, stability, and compliance are demonstrated through formal testing.
