# **RAG Email System – Validation and Test Plan**

### **Purpose**

This plan defines how the RAG email system will be validated prior to broader deployment.
The objective is to ensure that the system performs reliably, produces accurate and well-sourced responses, and operates within agreed cost and compliance boundaries.

## **Testing Roadmap**

| **Phase**                       | **Objective**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                        | **Exit Criteria**                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Internal Readiness**       | Confirm system stability                        | Verify integrations between Gmail, Workato, and Google Cloud. Resolve functional defects.                              | Core services operate without error.                                               |
| **2. Shadow Testing (Alpha)**   | Assess performance in a non-interactive setting | The system runs in the background, generating draft responses without sending emails. Results are logged for analysis. | ≥95% correctly sourced answers. ≤5% factual errors. Stable processing performance. |
| **3. Controlled Evaluation**    | Validate accuracy using known data              | Evaluate output against a predefined “golden set” of sample emails and expected answers.                               | Quantified accuracy and grounding scores.                                          |
| **4. Limited Pilot (Beta)**     | Measure value under human supervision           | Draft responses appear in Gmail for a small user group. Users review and send manually.                                | Drafting time reduced by 50–60%. User satisfaction ≥4/5.                           |
| **5. Scale and Safety Testing** | Confirm operational readiness                   | Assess throughput, error handling, and access controls under higher volume.                                            | Consistent performance and no compliance issues.                                   |
| **6. Go / No-Go Review**        | Decision point for wider release                | Consolidate findings, costs, and risk assessments for leadership approval.                                             | Formal decision recorded and rollback plan verified.                               |

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**          | ≥95% grounded and factually correct responses |
| **Reliability**       | ≥99% successful message processing            |
| **Latency**           | 90% of responses generated within 6 seconds   |
| **Efficiency**        | 50–60% reduction in manual drafting time      |
| **User Satisfaction** | ≥4/5 average rating during pilot              |
| **Compliance**        | Zero incidents or data breaches               |

## **Risk Management**

| **Risk**                      | **Mitigation**                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Inaccurate responses          | Multi-phase validation and human review during pilot  |
| Sensitive data exposure       | Controlled permissions, encryption, and audit logging |
| Cost overrun                  | Cost monitoring and per-email budget limits           |
| Misunderstanding of AI output | Clear labeling of AI-generated drafts                 |
| Service instability           | Defined rollback plan and redundant data storage      |

## **Indicative Timeline**

| **Week** | **Activity**                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1        | Internal readiness                 |
| 2–3      | Shadow testing (Alpha)             |
| 3        | Controlled evaluation (golden set) |
| 4–6      | Limited pilot (Beta)               |
| 7        | Scale and safety validation        |
| 8        | Go / No-Go review                  |

### **Summary**

The testing approach is incremental and evidence-based.
Each phase is designed to confirm specific outcomes before progressing.
The system will not interact with end users until its accuracy, reliability, and compliance have been demonstrated through measured results.
